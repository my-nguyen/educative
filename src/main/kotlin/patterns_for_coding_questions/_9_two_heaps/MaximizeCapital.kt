    // i don't quite understand this solution
    // from educative
    // While selecting projects we have two constraints:
    // 1. We can select a project only when we have the required capital.
    // 2. There is a maximum limit on how many projects we can select.
    // Since we donâ€™t have any constraint on time, we should choose a project, among the projects for which we have
    // enough capital, which gives us a maximum profit. Following this greedy approach will give us the best solution.
    // While selecting a project, we will do two things:
    // 1. Find all the projects that we can choose with the available capital.
    // 2. From the list of projects in the 1st step, choose the project that gives us a maximum profit.
    // We can follow the Two Heaps approach similar to Find the Median of a Number Stream. Here are the steps of our algorithm:
    // 1. Add all project capitals to a min-heap, so that we can select a project with the smallest capital requirement.
    // 2. Go through the top projects of the min-heap and filter the projects that can be completed within our available
    //    capital. Insert the profits of all these projects into a max-heap, so that we can choose a project with the
    //    maximum profit.
    // 3. Finally, select the top project of the max-heap for investment.
    // 4. Repeat the 2nd and 3rd steps for the required number of projects
