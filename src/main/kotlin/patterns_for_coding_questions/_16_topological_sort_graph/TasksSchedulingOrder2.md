Course Schedule: There are ‘N’ courses, labeled from ‘0’ to ‘N-1’. Each course has some prerequisite courses which need
to be completed before it can be taken. Given the number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, write a method
to find the best ordering of the courses that a student can take in order to finish all courses.

Solution: This problem is exactly similar to our parent problem. In this problem, we have courses instead of tasks.
